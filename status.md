# 🛠️ Mautic Marketplace Frontend/Backend  
**📅 Status Update: August 1, 2025**

---

## ✅ Completed This Week

- **Comprehensive Code Review**  
  Conducted a full review of both the frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Deno/Supabase) codebases to assess production readiness.

- **Security Vulnerability Identified**  
  Discovered and patched a critical Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) flaw in the reviews table to prevent unauthorized data modifications.

- **Initial Performance Plan**  
  Flagged a major bottleneck in the frontend's `useEffect` fetching all reviews. Optimization strategy has been defined.

---

## 🚧 In Progress (Immediate Priority)

- **Code Cleanup & Refactoring**  
  Breaking down `App.jsx` into smaller, manageable components to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Supabase RLS Fix**  
  Deploying updated RLS policies to secure review data in production.

- **Frontend Error Handling**  
  Replacing console logs with user-friendly error messages for better UX and debugging.

## 🚀 Roadmap (Future Tasks)

- **Design Overhaul**  
  Rebuilding the UI using Tailwind CSS to achieve a clean, modern, and consistent visual language aligned with Mautic’s branding.

- **Component-Based Logic**  
  Refactoring to create reusable components like `<ReviewForm>`, `<ReviewList>`, `<LoginButton>`, etc.

- **Performance Optimization**  
  Updating the `useEffect` to only fetch relevant reviews to improve load times significantly.

- **DNS & Production Setup**  
  Coordinating with the team to establish a stable DNS for the API, avoiding temporary redirect hacks.

## 🗣️ Key Discussions & Decisions

- **John’s Technical Review**  
  The initial technical audit is complete. Next focus: production-level stability, code polish, and API security.

- **Ruth’s Design Vision**  
  Current UI is considered temporary. Tailwind CSS will be the foundation for aligning with Carbon Design System. Note: All packages must route through Packagist.

## ❓ Questions & Next Steps

- The core functionality is working, but full integration with the Marketplace UI is pending clarity.
- Will sync with **Anderson** next week to understand Carbon layout expectations.
- A short **team Zoom call** is suggested to align direction. Otherwise, we’ll continue iteratively with feedback.
