## Status: In Progress (Phase 1 - Ratings UI)

### Whatâ€™s done
- Built initial ratings & review UI component
- Placeholder data for stars and review
- Connected UI to template item page

### Next
- Connect to Supabase once credentials are available
- Hook up real data fetch & submit actions
- Handle auth / user flow

### Blockers / Questions
- Need production Supabase setup (Ruth/John?)
- Final design details (ask AJ?)
- Where to send user reviews? Direct to Supabase or via Mautic backend?
